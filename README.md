The Incinerator from L_Ender's Cataclysm is an incredibly cool weapon. However, only the skill's CoolDown can be modified in Cataclysm’s configuration file. And its weapon skill's damage and charging time sometimes is not satisfiying enough. 

This mod allows you to modify The Incinerator further through configuration files IncineratorsTryHard.toml.

Currently you can modify:

Basic Damage of the weapon skill;

Max Health Percent Damage of the weapon skill;

Charging Time.

灾变的炎葬/焚焰者是一把酷炫的武器，但是其战技有时却不尽如人意，且只有冷却时间可在灾变的配置文件中修改。本模组通过Mixin使得炎葬战技的蓄力时间，基础伤害和最大生命值伤害可通过配置文件IncineratorsTryHard.toml修改。

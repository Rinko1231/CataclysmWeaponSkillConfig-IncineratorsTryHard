L_Ender's Cataclysm has incredibly cool weapons. However, only a few of  weapon skill parameters can be modified in Cataclysmâ€™s configuration file. And the weapon skills' damage, charging time and so on sometimes are not satisfiying enough. 

This mod allows you to modify The Incinerator and some other weapons further through configuration files IncineratorsTryHard.toml.

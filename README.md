The Incinerator from L_Ender's Cataclysm is an incredibly cool weapon. However, only the skill's CoolDown can be modified in Cataclysm’s configuration file. And its weapon skill's damage and charging time sometimes is not satisfiying enough. 

This mod allows you to modify The Incinerator further through configuration files IncineratorsTryHard.toml.

Currently you can modify:

Basic Damage of the weapon skill;

Max Health Percent Damage of the weapon skill;

Charging Time.
